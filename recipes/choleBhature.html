    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Chickpeas
            <ol>
                <li>If using dried chickpeas, soak them overnight in water. Drain and pressure cook with water and a pinch of salt for 4-5 whistles until tender. Drain and set aside. (Skip this step if using canned chickpeas; rinse and set aside.)
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Cook the Chole
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil or ghee in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
                <li>Add minced garlic, grated ginger, and green chilies. Saut&eacute; until aromatic.</li>
                <li>Add chopped onions and saut&eacute; until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Stir in tomato puree, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and chole masala. Cook until the oil separates.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked chickpeas and mix well. Mash a few chickpeas for a thicker gravy.</li>
                <li>Add water to adjust the consistency and simmer for 10-12 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in garam masala and amchur powder (or lemon juice). Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Bhature Dough
            <ol>
                <li>Divide the dough into small balls and roll them into 6-8-inch circles.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai. Fry the rolled bhature one at a time until they puff up and turn golden.</li>
                <li>Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Serve</li>

    <p>Serve the hot chole in a bowl with freshly fried bhature on the side. Pair with sliced onions, green chilies, and lemon wedges for a complete experience.</p>
